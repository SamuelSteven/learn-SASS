# Learn SASS
This is my practice in learning and getting used to the SASS/SCSS syntax. Here, I practice the basics of SCSS such as SCSS nesting, variables, mixins, @use, flow control (if else, for, while, each), and the built-in function of SCSS, namely color. I'm interested in learning this language because I think learning this will help me a lot in bigger projects. After practicing it, I feel that SCSS provides effectiveness and efficiency in writing code CSS when the project gets bigger and there ara many css files.
